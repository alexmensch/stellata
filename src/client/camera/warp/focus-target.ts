// Per-object contract consumed by warp / focus-lerp / arrival code.
//
// The warp + camera-transition machinery operates on FocusTargets, NEVER
// on `kind` switch statements. Adding a new focusable object kind
// (planet, probe, exoplanet, nebula, …) consists of:
//
//   1. Implementing this interface (typically as a factory on Stellata
//      returning an object that closes over the per-kind catalog /
//      state / event-bus references).
//   2. Plumbing the new kind through click / pick handling so its
//      FocusTarget can be passed to `startWarp` / `focusStar`-style
//      entry points.
//
// The warp animation code (`updateWarp`, `finishWarp`, mid-Fly
// recentre, pin guard, scale-bar focus tracking, …) is kind-agnostic
// above this seam and does not need to change.
//
// See `docs/architecture.md` § FocusTarget contract for the bigger
// picture and the rationale (the unified arrival profile — the cubic-Hermite log-d
// Fly profile exposed a class of Float32-precision bugs in lookAt(B)
// that recentring the floating origin mid-Fly fixes; the kind-agnostic
// version of that fix lives on this contract so future kinds inherit
// the correctness automatically).
