 * the same physical location in the new frame.
 *
 * Called from `updateWarp` at observe→observe phase-3 start, the only
 * frame in which the floating origin moves mid-warp. After this:
 *   - `pEnd` keeps the parallax slerp `pEnd → B` landing on the same
 *      physical waypoint (the catalog-absolute destination), so `B`
 *      re-bound in the new local frame stays at the lerp endpoint.
 *   - `A` and `pStart` stay frame-coherent with `pEnd`, eliminating
 *      the "phase-3 mutates pEnd in place but leaves A/pStart in the
 *      source frame" footgun for future readers.
