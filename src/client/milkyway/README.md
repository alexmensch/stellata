# Milky Way volumetric disc

`milkyway.ts` + `milkyway.{vert,frag}.glsl` render the integrated
surface brightness of unresolved Galactic stars by raymarching through
**two proxy meshes** anchored at the galactic centre — a flattened
disc (30 × 30 × 1.2 kpc envelope) and an oblate bulge (10 × 10 × 6 kpc
envelope), both rotated so their short axes align with NGP. Each
fragment ray-sphere-intersects its mesh in mesh-local frame, then
raymarches log-distributed steps from front-face entry (or the camera
position, if the camera is inside the mesh) to the back-face fragment,
accumulating emission with running dust extinction. The two meshes'
contributions add via additive blending. Default-on; URL `mw=0`
disables. Hidden in chart mode.

## Files

- `milkyway.ts` — volumetric disc + bulge renderer. Composes the two
  proxy meshes; owns the `setIsobar` chart-mode handoff (currently
  hides the meshes when chart engages).
- `milkyway.vert.glsl`, `milkyway.frag.glsl` — ray-sphere intersect +
  log-distributed raymarch, additive-blended.
- `milkyway-tuning.ts` — Milky Way section of the debug panel
  (brightness, density, extinction, reddening RGB sliders).

`galactic-coords.ts` (`GAL_TO_ICRS`, `GALACTIC_CENTRE_PC`) lives in
`../galactic/` and is imported here for the GC-anchored mesh
placement.

## Why a volumetric mesh, not a skybox

An earlier version (rev 1) put the integration in a 50 kpc
camera-anchored skybox sphere and marched camera→back-surface.
Mathematically defensible, but visually it was a "theatre backdrop":
the geometry doing the work was a 2D sphere enclosing the camera, so
flying past the bulge produced no parallax — the band reoriented in
odd ways and the disc never read as an actual 3D shape from outside.
The volumetric-mesh approach replaces the enclosing sphere with the
*actual disc shape*, so standard 3D rasterisation handles parallax by
construction. From outside, you see a flattened glowing lens; from
inside, the path length through the volume varies naturally with view
direction (long along the plane, short toward NGP) producing the right
band geometry.

## Density profiles

Constants baked into `milkyway.ts`; no runtime data loads.

- **Disc**: `density0 × exp(-(R-R₀)/3000pc) × exp(-|z|/300pc)` — single
  double-exponential thin-disc-like profile. The originally-planned
  Jurić thin/thick/halo decomposition was simplified out during
  iteration; the smooth single component reads convincingly enough
  that the extra components weren't worth the calibration cost.
- **Bulge**: `density0 × exp(-r'/1000pc)` where
  `r' = sqrt(R² + (z/q)²)` is the oblate-spheroid radius with q = 0.6.
  Simple exponential rather than McMillan's power-law-times-Gaussian
  — the latter produced too-tight a "ball" that read as point-source-
  like in iteration.

Each component multiplies a population colour pre-integration, so the
band's hue varies by line of sight. Defaults are visually calibrated:

- `DISC_COLOR` pale-lavender (171,168,223), `DENSITY0 = 1.5`
- `BULGE_COLOR` near-white-warm (255,246,237), `DENSITY0 = 18`

## Magnitude consistency with stars

Each fragment converts integrated emission to an effective apparent
magnitude:

```
appMag = uGlowMagOffset - 2.5 × log10(integratedIntensity)
```

and derives a slider-driven gain:

```
gate = max((uMaxAppMag - appMag) / uSizeSpan, 0)   // no upper clamp
```

folded into the tone-map exponent:

```
result = 1 - exp(-colorAccum × brightness × gate)
```

The lack of upper clamp on `gate` matters. An earlier version clamped
it to [0, 1] and applied as a post-tone-map multiplier, which made
bright sightlines plateau the moment they reached "fully visible".
Folding gate into the exponent and removing the upper clamp lets the
slider continuously lift every sightline — dim NGP brightens, GC
saturates toward white.

`uMaxAppMag` and `uSizeSpan` are passed by-reference from the star
pipeline's shared uniforms map, so any `setFilter` change propagates
without duplicate bookkeeping.

`uGlowMagOffset` (default 15.0) calibrates volumetric "density × pc"
units to the star magnitude scale. `setGlowMagOffset(x)` — lower lifts
the layer through the gate sooner; higher demands a brighter slider.

The Local Group emission layer (`../local-group/README.md` § Emission
layer) reuses this exact gate + tone-map scheme per instance.

## Coordinate handling

The mesh-local unit sphere has +X/+Y aligned with the galactic disc
plane, +Z toward NGP. `mesh.scale` extends to galactocentric pc per
axis (disc 15000×15000×600; bulge 5000×5000×3000). `mesh.quaternion =
GAL_TO_ICRS` rotates galactic axes into ICRS world axes. The shader
transforms `cameraPosition` (renderer-local) → galactocentric ICRS
(subtract `uGalCenter`) → galactocentric galactic (rotate by
`uIcrsToGal`) → mesh-local (divide by `uMeshScalePc`): that's
`camLocal`. Ray-sphere intersection in this frame yields entry t
(clamped ≥ 0 if camera is inside) and exit t = 1 (back-face fragment
is on the unit sphere by construction). 32 log-distributed steps run
from tEnter to 1, with `|vWorldPos - cameraPosition|` converting back
to world parsec step size for dust optical-depth maths.

## Analytical-only dust (no voxel sampling here)

Profile is `norm × exp(-(R-R₀)/3500pc) × exp(-|z|/125pc)` — Drimmel &
Spergel-style thin-disc dust. Per step, opacity converts to per-channel
optical depth via CCM-derived reddening multipliers `(0.76, 1.0, 1.35)`
— red transmits most, blue extincts away — applied with Beer-Lambert
running attenuation including a half-step self-shielding term.
`setExtinctionStrength(x)` scales the dust globally; default 0.45.

The Edenhofer dust voxel grid is **intentionally not sampled here**.
Voxels have ~5 pc native structure designed for short per-star
sightlines. Sampling at coarse step intervals along long camera →
fragment rays (8-15 kpc) aliases into visible parallel streaks
regardless of step distribution. Voxels stay in use for per-star
extinction in the star pipeline; molecular cloud ellipsoids carry the
discrete near-cloud detail in front of the band.

## Render path

Two meshes, both `THREE.BackSide`, additive blending, `depthTest =
true` (so close-range star cores can occlude this layer), `depthWrite
= false` (the glow never occludes anything later), `frustumCulled =
false` (the local bounding sphere is at origin but world position is
`GALACTIC_CENTRE_PC - worldOffset`). `renderOrder = -3` for both
meshes.

The meshes are NOT camera-anchored — they sit at the galactic centre.
`update()` rebases each mesh's position to
`GALACTIC_CENTRE_PC - worldOffset` per frame so under the floating-
origin recentering both project correctly into the renderer-local
frame. The `vWorldPos - cameraPosition` subtraction in the shader is
float-stable for the same reason the star pipeline is: both operands
are renderer-local with small magnitudes.

## Brightness baseline

`DEFAULT_BRIGHTNESS = 5.35e-6`. The volumetric integration produces
large `colorAccum` values (~10⁴–10⁵ along the GC sightline), so
brightness needs to be small to keep the tone-map curve in a useful
range. Calibrated empirically alongside `GLOW_MAG_OFFSET` — the two
settings cooperate, so retune them together if the visual feel
changes.

## Chart mode + warp

Chart mode swaps the volumetric raymarch for a single-line **isobar
contour** along the magnitude limit (a thin ink line tracking "where
the integrated MW would equal the visible magnitude limit" reads as a
paper-atlas equivalent of the volumetric band). The contour rendering
is handled by chart-mode wiring; this layer's `setIsobar(true)` simply
hides the meshes.

Warp keeps the layer visible in dark mode — the band reorienting as
the camera flies past the GC is the realism payoff.

No FPS gate. Toggle via the panel checkbox or `mw=0` URL.

## Dev levers

`milkyway-tuning.ts` registers the Milky Way section of the debug
panel: log-scale brightness slider + linear sliders for
`glowMagOffset` / `discDensity` / `bulgeDensity` / `extinctionStrength`
+ colour pickers for disc + bulge palette + three linear sliders for
the reddening RGB multipliers.

The same setters are individually callable under
`stellata.milkywayLayer.*`:

- `setBrightness(x)` — global gain in the tone-map exponent
- `setGlowMagOffset(x)` — magnitude calibration (raise → dimmer)
- `setDiscDensity(x)` / `setBulgeDensity(x)` — per-component emission
- `setDiscColor(r,g,b)` / `setBulgeColor(r,g,b)` — pre-extinction
  palette
- `setExtinctionStrength(x)` — analytical dust τ multiplier
- `setReddeningRGB(r,g,b)` — per-channel τ multiplier (CCM-derived)
