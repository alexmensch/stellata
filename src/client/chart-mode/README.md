# Chart mode

Paper-aesthetic alternate render path inspired by Sky Atlas 2000.0
(chart 22 reference). Activated by `M` keyboard or
`setFilter({ chart: true })`. **Observe-only** — the `chart-mode.ts`
orchestrator listens to the `'cameraMode'` event and auto-clears the flag
on observe→navigate. URL state persists `chart=1` only when both flags
are set (FLAG_CHART = 1 << 6 in the flags byte).

`chart-mode.ts` toggles four things on entry:

1. `body.chart` class for CSS palette swaps (paper background, ink
   labels, monochrome topbar / brand box / typeahead).
2. `applyTheme('mono')` — flips the existing dark-mode palette to the
   mono palette (already in `theme-toggle.ts`). Its `setMonochrome`
   fan-out is what swaps the cloud layer into its chart treatment
   (stippled silhouette outlines — `../molecular-clouds/README.md`
   § Rim shell render); the milky-way band↔isobar swap instead rides
   `applyDetailPreset` (step 3) through the `milkyWayIsobar` detail bind.
3. `applyDetailPreset(getDetailLevel())` — re-derives the permitted set
   from the chart floor column (see `../scene/README.md` § Detail-level
   declutter cycle). Drives the MW isobar swap, hides realistic-only
   structure, and gates the label tiers in step 4.
4. `stellata.chartLabels.start(ctx)` — spins up the per-frame label engine
   (`chart-labels.ts`), whose tiers are gated by the detail cycle.
5. Constellation figure flips to "always draw every constellation"
   (vs. only the highlighted one) so the chart shows the full asterism
   network. Passive — the WebGL `constellation-figure/` layer is rebuilt
   by the shell off the same `chart && observe` predicate, not toggled
   here. Subject to the master `showConstellation` toggle — when off, no
   asterism lines or constellation Latin labels render.

Exit reverses each step — `stop()` detaches the engine's bus
subscriptions and drains its SVG pools while keeping the catalog-derived
caches for the next entry; `dispose()` (the shell's teardown leg) drops
those too.

> **Shelved layer.** The Milky Way isobar is disabled —

## Star disc sizing — magnitude-driven

In chart mode the vertex shader replaces `max(appSize, physSize)` with
a **linear-in-magnitude** mapping (= log10-in-flux by definition of
magnitude). **Planet bodies take the identical treatment** (uadc.3
decision: magnitude disc + star-style name label, no glyph
vocabulary): `planet.vert.glsl` carries the same chart branch driven
by the same shared uniforms, the reflected-light appMag feeds the same
formula, and `PlanetBodyField.setMonochrome` swaps blending exactly
like the star pipeline's `setMonochromeBlend` (the spheroid mesh LOD
and the local depth pass idles in chart — rings
are hidden on paper). Planet name labels ride the chart-labels engine
(`kind-planet`, proper-name priority tier); `planet-labels.ts` stays
chart-hidden as before.

```glsl
chartT = clamp(
  (appMag - uChartMagBright) / max(uMaxAppMag - uChartMagBright, 0.001),
  0, 1);
pxSize = mix(uChartDiscMaxPx, uChartDiscMinPx, chartT);
vPhysRatio = 1.0;  // force the frag shader's disc-pass branch
```

Three tunable uniforms shared with JS via `getChartDiscParams()`:

- `uChartDiscMaxPx` (default 28 px) — diameter at the bright end.
- `uChartDiscMinPx` (default 1.5 px) — diameter at the faint end.
- `uChartMagBright` (default −2.0) — magnitude that maps to MAX
  (covers Sirius/Vega/etc. at any vantage short of standing-on-a-
  bright-star).

The mapping is **range-aware** — sliding the magnitude limit from 6.5
to 15 spreads the same disc-size range across more stars instead of
crowding everything to one corner. Variability magMod is added to
`appMag` *before* this formula runs so the inner disc keeps pulsing.

## Chart-mode disc rendering — flat hard-edged + per-vertex AA

The fragment shader's `uMonochrome > 0.5` branch renders a flat
disc (no super-Gaussian profile, no halo, no luminosity-class
softening) with a **one-pixel antialiased outer edge**:

```glsl
float aa = max(vAaWidth, 1e-3);
float disc = 1.0 - smoothstep(0.5 - aa, 0.5, r);
outColor = vec4(vec3(1.0 - disc), 1.0);  // black ink under MultiplyBlending
```

`vAaWidth = 1 / pxSize` is computed per-vertex and passed as a
varying. **Don't switch to `fwidth(r)`** — `length(vUv)` has an
undefined screen-space derivative at the quad centre (vUv = (0,0)),
which produces faint or invisible discs at any size. Per-vertex AA is
stable because the value is independent of the fragment's UV
position. The vertex shader sets `vAaWidth` in every return path
(early-out, hide-focus, invisible cull, both pxSize branches) so the
varying is always defined.

The disc-pass branch hard-clips at `vAppMag > uMaxAppMag` (no soft
taper, since a sub-pixel fade-in band reads as a hard cutoff anyway
on a paper chart).

## Chart treatments — Milky Way isobar + cloud outlines

- **Milky Way** (`milkyway.frag.glsl`): an `if (uChartIsobar > 0.5)`
  branch renders a single thin line, `line = 1 - smoothstep(fw*0.5,
  fw*1.5, |appMag - uMaxAppMag|)` where `fw = fwidth(appMag)`. The
  contour tracks "where the integrated brightness would equal the
  slider limit" — drag the magnitude slider and the contour moves
  through the band like a topographic line. Discarded outside the
  line so depth stays clean. Solid black ink (`uMonoColor`), toggled by
  `setMilkywayIsobar` with the shared `uMaxAppMag` uniform reference.
- **Molecular clouds** (`../molecular-clouds/cloud-rim.frag.glsl`): the
  rim-shell material's chart branch draws a **stippled silhouette
  outline** of each cloud's isosurface mesh — the SkyAtlas 2000 nebula
  convention — via `MolecularClouds.setMonochrome` (the registry
  fan-out), not an orchestrator call. The absorption pass hides
  entirely on paper.

## Label engine + glyphs (`chart-labels.ts`)

Per-frame engine that emits two SVG layers under `#overlay`. Each tier is
gated by the detail cycle — `tick()` reads `detailPermits(id)` per group
(star names + planets → `chartStarNameLabels`, Bayer → `chartBayerGlyphs`,
rings + wings → `chartVariableRings`, constellation names →
`chartConstellationNames`, cloud names → `chartCloudNames`) and skips the
group's build loop when the current level doesn't reach its chart floor.
See `../scene/README.md` § Chart-content wiring for the couplings.

- `<g id="chart-labels">` — `<text>` elements for proper-named stars,
  Bayer-letter Greek glyphs (drawn from `bayerMap` built in
  `search.ts`), constellation Latin names, and molecular cloud names.
- `<g id="chart-glyphs">` — `<circle class="chart-variable-ring">`
  per visible variable, `<line class="chart-binary-wings">` per
  visible binary primary (catalog flag bit 4).

**Greedy collision pass** with axis-aligned bounding rectangles, sorted
by priority (proper name 1 → Bayer 2 → cloud 3). Constellation names
**bypass** the collision pass entirely — they always render at
`#chart-labels .chart-label.kind-con`'s sparse semi-transparent outline
typography, allowed to overlap small star symbols underneath à la Sky
Atlas; see styles.css for the live size / weight / letter-spacing.

**Star-name + Bayer label offsets** scale with the rendered disc.
`starLabelOffsetPx(discPx) = max(STAR_LABEL_OFFSET_MIN_PX,
discPx/2 + STAR_LABEL_GAP_PX)` so the label's bottom-left corner clears
the disc edge across the chart-mode magnitude range (faint sub-pixel
discs keep the floor; the brightest 28 px disc pushes the label out
to 18 px diagonal). `discPx` comes from `chartDiscPxForAppMag` in
`chart-disc-pure.ts`, which mirrors the vertex shader's chart-branch
formula.

The constellation centroid is the **flux-weighted** position of every
member (`weight = 10^(-0.4 × appMag)` per star). The visibility gate
uses `min(appMag) ≤ maxAppMag` over all members. The full member walk
is needed to fix a bug where constellations with no single dominant
intrinsic-brightest star (Vela, Pyxis, Sagittarius, etc.) silently
dropped their label, but the result is **cached** under a 0.5 pc
camera-translation threshold + filter version. The cached centroid is
still re-projected every frame; only the inner per-member loop is
elided.

**Variable rings** are **intrinsic-only** — the ring set gates on
`periodDays > 0 && amplitudeMag > 0 && varType !== VAR_TYPE_ECLIPSING`.
Eclipsing binaries are extrinsically variable (line-of-sight
occlusion, not the star's own output), so they surface via the wings
glyph instead and never draw a ring. Rings size to the bright-extreme
magnitude (`appMag - amplitude/2`) plus a `VARIABLE_RING_MIN_GAP_PX = 1.0`
radial gap, so the ring stays visibly outside the inner disc even at
peak phase for low-amplitude variables. The gap means the ring no
longer encodes "exact maximum brightness" — that's a deliberate trade
for glyph legibility.

**Binary wings** are screen-aligned horizontal `<line>`s extending
`discPx * BINARY_WING_EXTENSION_RATIO` (0.25) past each disc edge.
The proportional extension keeps the glyph readable across the
full chart-mode magnitude range — 16 px discs get 4 px wings,
6 px discs get 1.5 px wings — instead of overwhelming faint stars
with the fixed 4 px stub the earlier implementation drew. Below a
`BINARY_WING_MIN_EXTENSION_PX = 1.5 px` floor the wings would be
sub-pixel and the underlying disc is too faint to register as a
double anyway, so the glyph is skipped entirely rather than
rendered as a degenerate stub. SVG line coordinates are in
viewport space, so the wings stay horizontal regardless of camera
roll by construction. Both glyph classes share the per-frame
`renderableAppMag` filter — same spectMask + distance gates as the
GPU disc — so a hidden inner disc takes its glyph offscreen with
it.

**CPU/GPU dust mismatch.** Dust extinction is intentionally **not**
replicated CPU-side (per-star raymarch too expensive for the label
loop). For stars sitting behind heavy dust (Cygnus, Ophiuchus,
Aquila Rift) the GPU renders a much smaller disc than the CPU
mirror computes, so wings sized to the CPU disc would dwarf the
real rendered disc. The 1.5 px floor on the wing extension acts as
a heuristic guard — it requires the un-extincted CPU disc to be
≥ 6 px before wings render, which gives ~2 mag of headroom for
dust to attenuate the GPU disc without orphaning the glyph. The
trade is a few legitimate wings dropped on faint un-extincted
stars near the magnitude limit. **The proper fix when needed:**
ship a coarser (~128³ resample of Edenhofer 2023, ~2 MiB) CPU-side
voxel grid and raymarch per CCDM-flagged binary in the per-frame
label loop, cached by camera position. That's the right answer for
chart-mode use from far-from-Sol viewpoints, where this heuristic
breaks down further (dust columns change as the camera moves and
the heuristic stays static). Left as future work; the heuristic is
adequate for current near-Earth chart-mode use.

**Pooling.** Each `<text>` / `<circle>` / `<line>` is keyed by stable
identity (`n:idx`, `b:idx`, `c:conIdx`, `m:cloudIdx`) so adding /
removing nodes is free across frames. Unused entries are detached at
the end of each tick.

## Picking under chart mode

Click-pick tracks **render visibility** identically for every kind: a
body is click-pinnable iff it is currently drawn. Chart mode hard-clips
the star disc at `uMaxAppMag` (no soft taper — § Star disc sizing), so
`pickStar`'s cutoff drops the `SOFT_TAPER_MARGIN_MAG` it adds in
navigate; `PlanetBodyField.pick` applies the same hard clip in chart
mode and sizes its hit radius from the chart disc px
(`chartDiscPxForAppMag`) instead of the physical/perceptual disc. The
shared cutoff constant lives in
`solar-system/perceptual-magnitude.ts`.

`Picker.pickStar` (`camera/picker.ts`) three fixes for the small-disc /
variable case:

1. **Variable bright-extreme filter.** Filter check uses
   `appMag - amplitude/2` so a variable whose disc is only visible at
   peak phase remains pickable across the whole cycle. Without this,
   GPU shows the disc but the picker can't see it.
2. **Disc hit-radius floor.** `MIN_DISC_HIT_RADIUS_PX = 4`. Tiny
   chart-mode discs (1–2 px) get a 4 px hit target so the cursor can
   realistically land within it; larger discs are unaffected. The
   14 px proximity fallback is unchanged but only fires if no other
   disc has won, which on a crowded chart it often has.
3. **pickScore tiebreak.** Within the prime tier (cursor inside a
   rendered disc), the cursor's pixel distance to each candidate's
   projected centre wins (`pickScore = pxDist + appMag *
   PICK_MAG_BIAS_PX_PER_MAG`, with `PICK_MAG_BIAS_PX_PER_MAG = 0.05`
   in `star-geometry.ts`). Visually-resolved pairs whose hitboxes
   overlap stay independently clickable — the Double Double (ε¹/ε²
   Lyr) is the canonical case. The sub-pixel mag bias tiebreaks
   coincident catalog companions sharing x/y/z, e.g. Alula Australis
   A/B (Gl 423A/B at identical coordinates). Camera distance is
   deliberately ignored in this tier — see the `pickScore` docstring
   for the trade-off.

## Binary indication coverage

Wings are driven by `flags` bit 4. Three build-time passes set that bit:

- **Geometric inference** in `build-catalog.ts` — finds AT-HYG rows
  where both components of a pair survive the classic_ids cut
  (~14 systems; α Cen-style cases).
- **CCDM + MultFlag HIP-keyed cross-match** — every Hipparcos star
  carries a `CCDM` column linking it to the Catalog of the
  Components of Double and Multiple stars (Dommanget & Nys 1994).
  CCDM alone is too permissive (tags ~19k stars including many
  wide line-of-sight optical pairs like Vega and Pollux), so the
  build gates it with Hipparcos's own `MultFlag` — keep only
  `{C, G, O}` (component / resolved-in-field / orbit-known); drop
  blank, `V`, and `X`. A small curated `KNOWN_VISUAL_DOUBLES` map
  in `build-catalog.ts` recovers canonical pairs Hipparcos
  modelled as single stars (Polaris, ε¹ Lyr, 61 Cyg A/B). Surfaces
  Sirius, Mizar, Castor, α Cen, Albireo, γ And, ε Lyr, 70 Oph,
  Procyon, Algol, etc. without the optical-pair tail.
- **Eclipsing binaries** — every `VAR_TYPE_ECLIPSING` record (GCVS
  EA/EB/EW/ELL/E; EP eclipsing-by-planet excluded) that the two
  passes above didn't already flag. An eclipser's variability is
  the geometry of a stellar multiple, so it earns wings, not a
  variable ring (see § Label engine — variable rings above).

All three passes hit the same flag bit, so chart-mode rendering is
agnostic to which source flagged a given star. The build-time filter
rationale + parser format are in the catalog build's CCDM cross-match
section.
