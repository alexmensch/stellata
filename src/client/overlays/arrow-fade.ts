 *
 * Policy-agnostic: takes one shaft length, returns one alpha. Each caller
 * decides what shaft length to feed (a shared `max(sibling, …)` for a
 * paired group, or its own drawn length for a per-arrow fade). See
 * `focusedArrowFadeAlpha` for the policy wrapper.
 *
 * - shaftLengthPx ≤ 0 → returns 1. No drawn shaft to fade; the consumer
 *   will hide the arrow on geometry grounds. Guards against a zero-length
 *   state producing coverage = ∞ and wrongly driving alpha to 0.
 * - discRadiusPx ≤ shaftStartPx → returns 1. Disc hasn't reached the

/**
 * Full alpha for a focused-star reference arrow under the current camera
 * mode + transition state. Combines the camera-state gate with the disc-
 * coverage smoothstep so both consumers (HUD Sol/GC arrows, distance-
 * vector overlay) make the same decision from the same inputs within a
 * frame.
 *
 * Per-arrow vs. shared shaft length is the caller's choice: the HUD
 * Sol/GC chevrons feed `max(solLen, gcLen)` so the
 * pair fades together, while the distance-vector overlay feeds its own
 * drawn shaft length so a long focal-star → destination arrow outlasts
 * the shorter Sol/GC chevrons by design.
 *
 * Gate semantics:
 * - During an observe transition: only the 'enter' kind fades — the
 *   chrome melts away as the camera dives into the focal star. The 'exit'
 *   kind snaps to 1 to avoid double-easing while the disc is shrinking
 *   back to its parked size.
 * - Steady-state observe: alpha = 1 (the focal star isn't centered in
 *   view, no disc-coverage problem to solve).
 * - Steady-state navigate: fade engages.
