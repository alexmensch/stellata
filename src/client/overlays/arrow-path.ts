 *
 * Perspective-projection-based derivations (project the target and take
 * the screen delta from origin) collapse when the target is behind the
 * camera: the projection chain divides by z and sign-flips. View-space
 * arithmetic sidesteps that — the camera-local (x, y) of a direction is
 * the screen-plane offset regardless of front or behind, so a target the
 * user must turn 180° to see still yields a useful arrow direction.
 *
 * Browser screen y is inverted vs. view-space y (down-positive vs.
 * up-positive), hence the y flip.
 *
 * Returns null only when the direction is exactly along the camera axis
 * (view-space x and y both ≈ 0) — no rotation brings such a target into
 * view in any preferred direction.
