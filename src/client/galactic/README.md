# Sky reference system

Layers that anchor the local star clump against the sky: the galactic
disc outline (always-on midplane ring + bulge wireframe), the two
toggleable coordinate spheres (galactic l/b and equatorial RA/Dec), and
the HUD layer (Sol/GC arrows plus the OBSERVE-mode ring). Together they
give the user "which way is out, how far am I from the centre" without
obscuring the local stars.

Local Group wireframes + per-galaxy labels are a separate layer; see
`src/client/local-group/README.md`.

**Shared module** `galactic-coords.ts` exports `GAL_TO_ICRS` (Matrix4)
and `GALACTIC_CENTRE_PC` (Vector3 at R₀ = 8.122 kpc), built from the
J2000 IAU galactic-pole and galactic-centre angles with explicit
re-orthogonalisation. The Milky Way volumetric layer reuses these
constants directly — keep the module minimal and stable.

**Galactic disc outline** (`galactic-disc.ts`) — *on in dark mode at
detail level ≥ representational, hidden in chart mode*. The declutter
cycle gates it as `galacticDiscWireframe` (floor `representational`); the
per-frame warp/fade update is skipped when the detail cycle doesn't
permit it (`../scene/README.md` § Detail-level declutter cycle). A 15 kpc
midplane ring, two thickness rings at
±1800 pc, and a 5 kpc × 3 kpc bulge wireframe (three orthogonal ring
loops in the galactic frame), all centred on the galactic centre — Sol
sits ~8 kpc *inside* the disc, not at its middle.

**Every extent is imported from the Milky Way proxy meshes**
(`../milkyway/milkyway-column-pure.ts` `DISC_RADIUS_PC` /
`DISC_HALF_THICKNESS_PC` / `BULGE_RADIUS_PC` /
`BULGE_HALF_THICKNESS_PC`), never restated here. The wireframe's job is
to outline the volume that emits, so any divergence renders band light
outside its own outline — which is what the previous hand-set ±400 pc and
3 × 1.5 kpc did: 1.5× short vertically on the disc, and on the bulge 2×
vertically and 1.67× radially. Changing a mesh envelope now moves the
ring with it — the thickness rings tripled when the disc gained its thick
component (`../milkyway/README.md` § Density profiles).

Each ring is a basic
`LineLoop` whose vertices are pre-baked once into absolute ICRS via
`GAL_TO_ICRS` plus the GC offset; per frame `discGroup.position` is
rebased to `-worldOffset` (via `.copy(worldOffset).negate()` on the
group's own position vector so the shared `worldOffset` is never
mutated). Opacity smoothsteps from 0 to 0.55 between
`FADE_INNER_PC = 500` pc and `FADE_OUTER_PC = 5000` pc distance-from-Sol
(constants hoisted to `galactic-fade.ts`, shared with the Local Group
wireframe layer so both reveal in lockstep). In chart mode the layer is
hidden entirely — a 15 kpc reference ring reads as visual noise on a
paper-chart aesthetic, and the arrows + sphere already provide
orientation.

## Distance fades

`galactic-fade.ts` owns both directions, so no layer writes its own curve:

- **Far-field reveal** — `smoothstep(FADE_INNER_PC = 500,
  FADE_OUTER_PC = 5000, distFromSol)`. Shared by the galactic disc and the
  Local Group wireframe so both reveal in lockstep.
- **Sol-frame self-hide** — `solFrameFadeFactor(distFromSol, window)`, the
  inverse, for layers that only describe the sky *from Sol* and so must
  vanish as the camera leaves. Shared by the IAU boundary arcs and the
  equatorial sphere. The two consumers pass **different windows** — the
  curve is what's shared, not the band. Its `!(outerPc > innerPc)` guard is
  load-bearing (`../constellation-boundaries/README.md` § Chart-mode layer):
  a NaN window has to hide the layer, because a NaN opacity never reads as
  ≤ 0 and would draw a Sol-frame layer at full strength from everywhere.

## Coordinate spheres

Both grids and their edge labels live in `coord-spheres/` — see
`coord-spheres/README.md`, which replaces this file for reads in there.
What matters from out here: they are **mutually exclusive**
(`filter.coordSphere` is a `'none' | 'galactic' | 'equatorial'` tri-state),
both sit at `SPHERE_RADIUS_PC` = 50 kpc, and the equatorial one is the sole
consumer of `solFrameFadeFactor` besides the IAU boundary arcs. One consumer
sits outside the layer entirely: the camera's roll snap-to-level reads
`coordSphereNorthPole(filter.coordSphere)`, so the alignment guide sticks to
whichever grid is up (`../camera/controls/input/README.md` § Snap-to-level).

## HUD

**Sol + Galactic Centre arrows** (part of the HUD — `hud-overlay.ts`,
toggled by `filter.showHud`, separately from the sphere/grid). Rendered
as **SVG** paths inside `#overlay`, not 3D meshes. Geometry is computed
entirely in screen space:

1. Project the origin (the focused object's live local position — any
   hard kind (star / planet / probe) via `focalLocalPositionInto` — else
   `controls.target`) into screen pixels. In the OBSERVE steady state the
   anchor is **forced** to screen centre by mode rather than detected: the
   camera is parked at the focal star only within the float32 position
   quantum, and that residual (which grows as the focal-frame ride /
   epoch re-advance translate the camera in float64 against a
   float32-written slot) projects from ~zero distance to an arbitrary
   point — the wandering HUD under time scrubbing. Degenerate projections
   (origin at/behind the camera) still fall back to centre in every other
   state, covering the rare frames near a transition endpoint.
2. Derive the projected arrow direction in 2D. Two paths, picked by which
   one is well-defined this frame: (a) when the target projects in front
   of the camera, take the screen-space vector from the anchor to the
   target's projection (the natural direction); (b) when the target is
   behind the camera, fall back to `viewSpaceScreenDirInto` from
   `arrow-path.ts` — the camera-local `(x, -y)` of the world direction.
   View-space arithmetic sidesteps the projection divide and is
   independent of camera-to-origin distance, so a target the user must
   turn 180° to see still yields a useful arrow direction. The previously-
   primary aux-step path was dropped: its screen magnitude was
   proportional to camera-to-origin distance, so at close approach it
   went sub-pixel and Sol vs GC could snap independently as their
   respective directions hit the per-arrow degenerate window.
3. Build `shaftStart = originScreen + shaftStartPx × screenDir` and `tip =
   shaftStart + shaftLengthPx × screenDir`, both in pixels. The shared
   `buildArrowSvgPath` helper emits the chevron arrowhead perpendicular
   to the projected shaft, so the wings always face the camera by
   construction (no 3D billboard math required). `shaftStartPx` is mode-
   aware (see "Shaft start radius" below) so the arrows attach to the
   visible ring — focus ring in navigate, HUD ring in observe — and lerp
   smoothly through the transition.

Critical invariant: `shaftStartPx` is applied in **screen space**, not
3D world space, so the gap from anchor to shaft start is always exact
regardless of how aligned the arrow's 3D direction is with the camera
view axis. This is what makes the navigate-mode arrows clear the 24 px
focus ring at every viewing angle (28 px = 24 + 4 halo gap), and what
makes the observe-mode arrows attach to the HUD ring rim at every FOV.
Computing the offset in 3D world space and then projecting (the obvious-
but-wrong approach) collapses the gap to sub-pixel when `dir` is parallel
to the view axis, and the shaft ends up inside whichever ring is meant
to clear it.

`shaftLengthPx` is nominally `ARROW_PIXEL_LENGTH = 110` but cinches
inward when the projected target sits inside the nominal shaft: the
target's local-frame position is projected and its screen offset along
`screenDir` gives `projAlong`. If `projAlong < 110 + shaftStartPx +
sizeMax`, the shaft shortens so the chevron tip sits `sizeMax` px short
of the target — keeps the arrow from crowding (or overlapping) the
target's rendered disc when zoomed in close. `sizeMax` is the
camera-panel "Max" pixel size. The shaft renders at any positive length;
the chevron itself scales linearly to zero below `CHEVRON_FULL_AT_PX = 16`
so a heavily-shrunk shaft doesn't end up dominated by a full-size
arrowhead. We hide only when shrink-to-target pushes the shaft length to
zero or negative.

Arrow hidden when no screen direction can be derived at all — both
target-projection and view-space-dir paths must fail, which only
happens when `dir` lies exactly along the camera view axis (measure-
zero orientation). Sol arrow also hidden when focused on Sol —
pointing at yourself adds nothing.

**Navigate-mode arrow fade.** As the user orbits close to a focused star,
the rendered disc grows past the standard chevron length and the
reference arrows would otherwise sit on top of the disc. The fade is
*per-arrow*: the Sol/GC chevron pair shares one alpha keyed on
`max(solDrawnLen, gcDrawnLen)` (so when one chevron is shortened by
its target projecting close to the focused star the still-full sibling
drives the threshold), and the distance-vector chevron computes its own
alpha against its own drawn shaft length. The distance-vector is
typically longer than the nominal Sol/GC chevrons — it spans focal star
→ destination — so it outlasts them by design. Each consumer feeds
*this frame's* shaft length (no one-frame lag — eliminates the
toggle-on flash that the prior last-frame-drawn-lengths design
produced). The shared smoothstep
lives in `../overlays/arrow-fade.ts`. Coverage is
`(discRadius − shaftStart) / shaftLength`, where `discRadius` is the
focal star's *peak-amplitude* disc radius (so a high-amplitude
variable's pulsation doesn't oscillate the fade). Smoothstep eased over
[0.5, 0.75] (`COVERAGE_FADE_START`, `COVERAGE_FADE_END`). During an
in-flight observe transition the alpha holds the *source*-mode value
(navigate-style disc-coverage fade during enter, alpha=1 during exit)
and snaps to the destination on completion — visible alpha changes
during the camera glide would render on top of the focal disc and look
like chrome floating over the star, so we wait for the transition to
finish.

Diagnostic readout: the **Arrows** section of the unified debug panel
(`debug.panel()`, or the hidden triple-tap-D affordance) shows live drawn
shaft lengths, behind-camera flags, direction-derivation paths, disc
radius, refLen, coverage, and alpha — including a red-border alert when
the two arrows are in independent draw states (one drawn while the other
is hidden, or front/behind disagreement) so transient snaps surface.

**HUD ring.** A translucent screen-centred circle drawn in OBSERVE mode
(and during the navigate↔observe transition) when `showHud` is on. The
ring's radius is fixed in **angular** units — it represents a constant
visual cone in the camera's field of view, so its on-screen pixel radius
scales **inversely with FOV**:

```
ringRadiusPx(fov, sizeMaxPx) = 5 × sizeMaxPx × (10 / fov)
```

Anchor: at the narrowest FOV (10°) the radius is `5 × f.sizeMax` — the
factor of 5 keeps the ring legibly large at typical FOVs (raw `sizeMax`
is single-digit pixels and would render as a dot). Above 10° the ring
shrinks `1/fov`, keeping the same angular size. Tying the anchor to `sizeMax` keeps the ring on the same visual
scale as the brightest stars in the scene; widening the camera FOV makes
both the stars and the ring shrink in lockstep, so the ring stays a
small but visible HUD widget at any zoom. The Sol/GC arrows attach to
the rim and swivel around it as the user looks around — the ring is the
visualisation of the conceptual "starts at this angular distance"
attachment point.

During the navigate→observe transition the ring grows from radius 0 to
`ringRadiusPx`, eased by the same `f` that drives `ObserveTransition.tick`.
The reverse direction shrinks it back to 0. The focus ring
(`focus-ring-overlay.ts`) does the opposite — its 24 px radius lerps to
0 on enter, back to 24 on exit — so the two circles morph through each
other and the arrows feel continuously attached to whichever circle is
dominant. The eased progress is exposed by
`stellata.observe.getProgress()`.

**Shaft start radius (unified).** `hud-overlay.ts` computes a single
`shaftStartPx` per frame as `activeRing + RING_HALO_GAP_PX` (4 px), where
`activeRing` is whichever ring is dominant this frame:

| State                                   | `activeRing`                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Navigate, no transition                 | `FOCUS_RING_RADIUS_PX` (24)                    |
| Observe, no transition                  | `ringRadiusPx(fov, sizeMaxPx)` (= R)           |
| Enter transition (`navigate → observe`) | `max(24·(1-f), R·f)`                           |
| Exit transition (`observe → navigate`)  | `max(24·f, R·(1-f))`                           |

So the arrow shaft sits 4 px outside whichever circle is currently
visible — same halo gap in both steady states, smooth lerp through the
transition. In the OBSERVE steady state the anchor is forced to screen
centre (see step 1 above) — the post-transition switch is invisible
because the focal-star projection has already drifted to centre by
`f = 1`. Distance labels measure from `origin` so the displayed
distance reflects "from the focal object", which is meaningful in both
modes. The focal position (never `controls.target`) is load-bearing in
observe: `observeUpdateTarget` keeps `controls.target` parked 1 pc
ahead of the camera there, so a target-based origin would report every
distance ~1 pc off — invisible for the galactic centre, but "Sol ·
3.3 ly" from a planet-anchored observe where the truth is ~1 AU.

SVG distance labels (`#sol-arrow-label`, `#gc-arrow-label`) sit at
`tip + (LABEL_OFFSET_PX + ARROW_HEAD_DEPTH_PX, -LABEL_OFFSET_PX)` —
same exact offsets as the distance vector's label. Labels are
**clickable** (`pointer-events: auto` + cursor:pointer) — clicking
either invokes `Stellata.aimAt(localPoint)` which slerps the camera
around `controls.target` to centre the named object in view. Duration
scales with rotation angle, capped at 2 s and floored at 250 ms;
TrackballControls is disabled for the duration so its damping doesn't
fight the slerp. In-flight aim is superseded if a warp starts.

**Shared arrow path** (`arrow-path.ts`) — the `buildArrowSvgPath(shaftStartX,
shaftStartY, tipX, tipY)` helper builds shaft + chevron arrowhead given
two screen-space endpoints. Used by both the distance vector overlay and
the Sol/GC arrows so all three on-screen arrows share one silhouette,
one chevron size (5 × 4 px), and one label-placement convention. Also
exports `ARROW_LABEL_OFFSET_PX` and `ARROW_LABEL_PADDING_PX`.

The **distance vector** (`distance-vector-overlay.ts`) was unified
onto the same path — it's now a solid shaft + chevron rather than a
chain of repeated chevrons. Symmetric 28 px insets from each
star (was asymmetric 28/14). Label format unified to
`<destination name> · <distance>` (matches Sol/GC's `<target> ·
<distance>` form), and the label is anchored at the chevron tip with
the same offset as the Sol/GC labels rather than at the vector
midpoint. Clicking it aims the camera at the destination, matching
the Sol/GC label affordance (warp stays on the `W` key).

**State + UI:** two independent FilterState fields:

- `coordSphere` — which sphere is up (`'none'` default). Panel 3-stop
  control under **Overlays**, mirroring the detail-level stops; `S` cycles
  it (`../ui/README.md`). On the wire it is FLAG_GRID plus zero-byte
  presence bit 24 (`../util/url-state/README.md`): FLAG_GRID alone means
  galactic, so a pre-equatorial shared link still restores a sphere and a
  client predating bit 24 ignores it and shows the galactic one rather than
  none.
- `showHud` — gates the HUD: Sol/GC arrows in both modes, plus the
  OBSERVE-mode ring. URL `hud=1`, default-omitted. Panel checkbox lives
  under **Overlays** ("Head up display (HUD)"), directly after the
  coordinate sphere it orients against — the HUD is chrome drawn over the
  scene, which is what that section collects, and **Navigation** is now
  units only. Future HUD widgets hang off the same flag.

Neither sphere is in the declutter cycle — both are user-owned chrome
(`galacticCoordSphere` / `equatorialCoordSphere` in `USER_OWNED_IDS`,
`../scene/README.md`), too many lines to sweep with a detail level.

The disc has no *dedicated* checkbox by design — it's the orientation
primitive the catalog itself was missing, and is hidden in chart mode
anyway. It is part of the declutter cycle, though: the detail level
(`V` / the 3-stop control) hides it below `representational`.

**Chart mode**:
- Disc layer hides entirely (the 15 kpc reference ring reads as
  visual noise on a paper-chart background).
- Either sphere swaps stroke colour to `CHART_REFERENCE_INK` (`#3a3530`,
  `../chart-mode/chart-palette.ts` — shared with the IAU constellation
  boundaries, which draw the same ink at half weight and dotted; the grid
  stays solid), no transparency, no blending. The equator/line opacity
  split is dropped in chart mode (paper-chart aesthetic doesn't fade) —
  except under an active Sol-distance fade, which keeps blending on
  (`coord-spheres/README.md` § Coordinate spheres).
- Sol/GC arrows + HUD ring + POI ring/arrow/labels all flip to a deep
  saturated blue palette (`rgba(30, 64, 175, 0.85)`, the existing
  `--accent` token) with white halos on labels — distinct from
  pure-black chart ink so the HUD reads as a separate navigational
  layer. Strong contrast against the beige paper background (~7:1).
  Distance vector keeps a separate dark slate stroke since it's a
  measurement, not part of the HUD. All routed via CSS on
  `.gal-arrow*`, `.hud-ring`, `.poi-*`, and `#dist-line*` — no
  per-frame palette logic; `setMonochrome(on)` on `HudOverlay` is
  intentionally empty since the SVG class routing handles it.

**Warp visibility:** each layer's registry entry
(`src/client/scene/README.md`) hides the 3D disc + both sphere groups while
`ctx.warpActive`; SVG arrow paths and labels are
hidden via the existing `body.warping #overlay { display: none }` rule.

**Camera matrix freshness:** the HUD's registry entry calls
`camera.updateMatrixWorld()` before any SVG projection. `controls.update()`
mutates `camera.position`/`quaternion` but doesn't propagate to
`matrixWorld`/`matrixWorldInverse` — the renderer would do that for us,
but the SVG projection runs *before* `renderer.render()`, so without
this call the labels lag by one frame during fast camera moves.
