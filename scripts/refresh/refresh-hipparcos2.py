"""Refresh data/hipparcos/hip2_van_leeuwen.tsv — Hipparcos-2 (van Leeuwen 2007) reduction.

Phase 1 of the source-ID-anchored catalogue-pipeline rewrite.
HIP2 (VizieR I/311/hip2) is the improved astrometric reduction of all
117,955 HIP stars on a longer baseline than the original ESA 1997 release.
Critical for the bright-binary fallback (Phase 2 Stage 3):
where Gaia DR3's 5-parameter PM is corrupted by orbital wobble in close
binaries (Sirius, α Cen, Castor, Algol) or by saturation (V ≲ 4 — Sirius A,
Polaris, Vega), HIP2 averages over a different window on the orbit and is
often the truer single-star PM.

Reference epoch: J1991.25 for the entire catalogue. NOT stored per-row —
downstream consumers (build-binaries.py) must roll positions forward via
the per-row PM to whatever epoch they consume on.

    ORDER BY "HIP"

Schema discovered by live probe — the VizieR-on-the-wire column names
differ from the van Leeuwen 2007 paper conventions and from the bead spec.
Notably: `RArad`/`DErad` are MISNAMED — the values are stored in degrees
(verified against Sirius A at J1991.25: RArad=101.288°). The script
renames to Stellata-canonical lowercase on write.

TSV columns (11)
    hip               int   — Hipparcos identifier
    ra_icrs           float — RA at J1991.25, deg
    de_icrs           float — Dec at J1991.25, deg
    plx               float — parallax, mas
    e_plx             float — parallax uncertainty, mas
    pm_ra             float — proper motion in RA*cos(dec), mas/yr
    pm_de             float — proper motion in Dec, mas/yr
    e_pm_ra           float — pm_ra uncertainty, mas/yr
    e_pm_de           float — pm_de uncertainty, mas/yr
    goodness_of_fit   float — HIP2 F2 statistic (chi² GoF, ~N(0,1) when good)
    n_transits        int   — number of HIP transits used in the solution

Backend: CDS only. I/311/hip2 is a VizieR-published external catalogue
not hosted on the ESA Gaia archive, so the default ESA→CDS fallback does
not apply.

Idempotent — exits early if the output is newer than this script. Pass
`--force` to rebuild unconditionally.
