"""Refresh data/gaia/gaia_dr3_tyc_xmatch.tsv — Tycho-2 → Gaia DR3 source_id cross-walk.

Phase 1 of the source-ID-anchored catalogue-pipeline rewrite (stellata-dch).
Companion to scripts/refresh/refresh-gaia-hip-xmatch.py: HIP covers V ≲ 9 and
Tycho-2 (with TDSC merged in) extends down to V ~ 11.5, so this TSV is
how the Stage 1 indexer resolves any Tycho-2 / TDSC component to a Gaia
DR3 source_id without a position match.

ADQL
    SELECT
      original_ext_source_id AS tyc,
      source_id              AS gaia_source_id,
      angular_distance,
      number_of_neighbours,
      xm_flag
    FROM gaiadr3.tycho2tdsc_merge_best_neighbour
    WHERE source_id IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY original_ext_source_id

`gaiadr3.tycho2tdsc_merge_best_neighbour` is the official Gaia DR3 ×
(Tycho-2 + TDSC) cross-match — ~2.52M rows, all with a non-null
source_id. The merged source catalogue rolls TDSC double-star
components into Tycho-2 identifiers; rows are keyed by the bare
`NNNN-NNNN-N` form (no "TYC " prefix).

TSV columns (5)
    tyc                  str   — Tycho-2 / TDSC identifier ("NNNN-NNNN-N")
    gaia_source_id       int   — Gaia DR3 source_id
    angular_distance     float — match separation, arcsec (6 decimals)
    number_of_neighbours int   — ambiguity flag (1 = unique Gaia neighbour)
    xm_flag              int   — Gaia cross-match flag (see DR3 docs)

Identical 5-column shape to refresh-gaia-hip-xmatch.py so Stage 1 can
ingest both with one parser.

Idempotent — exits early if the output is newer than this script. Pass
`--force` to rebuild unconditionally. Backend fallback (ESA → CDS) is
provided by refresh_lib.TapClient.

Venv setup (see scripts/requirements-refresh.txt):
    python3 -m venv .venv
    .venv/bin/pip install -r scripts/requirements-refresh.txt
    .venv/bin/python scripts/refresh/refresh-gaia-tyc-xmatch.py
